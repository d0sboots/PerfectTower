## Making changes

Modifying the code requires the enchanced editor at https://d0sboots.github.io/perfect-tower, because it
`:import`s some scripts to use as macro libraries.

The editor has a source-import feature, used the same way you import scripts.
The following will set up a new workspace for the museum:
```{"workspaces":{"D0S.Museum":[["museum_macros","; Standardized (package) naming across all the scripts\n#script(name) D0S.Museum v4.7:{name}\n#garbage_requested {script(%%museum-nop%%)}\n\n; Keybindings. You can edit these here, or edit them in the scripts directly\n; (but it will be much more error-prone).\n#up w\n#down s\n#start m\n\n; Name of the budget variable, which begins the script-hiding block.\n#budget \"<size=0>mb**\"\n\n; Turn an element string into an index.

Based on the tier of the stones we\n; can buy, they cost 2000 * 18^in_tier / 18 each. (We ignore the extra cost\n; of universal stones.) This determines how many stones we can buy, and thus,\n; the max tier.\n; There is an extra division by 9 and a floor. This means that if the level can't\n; be raised by at least 2 levels, the quantity in the log will be rounded down to 0,\n; and thus the log will result in -infinity. We add back the 2 levels on the outside.\n#up_tiers(in_tier) floor(\\\n  gdg({budget}) / (100.0 * 2000.0 * 9.0 / 18.0) / (18.0 ^ ({in_tier}))\\\n) // 3.0 + 2.0\n\n; The top tier that can be achieved, given input stones of \"in_tier\".

When we set preferred tier to \"pref\", we get stones in\n; the range [pref-10, pref], at uniform. We want our best stone to be in that\n; range - the one that we can *just* afford to do +11 levels from. Stones smaller\n; than that fall off at a rate of 1 tier/level, and stones higher fall off at a\n; rate of (18 log 3 - 1), or ~1.63 tiers/level. To maximize the potential of the\n; range, we want the top and bottom of the range to have equally high max_tiers,\n; so max_tier(pref - 10.5) = max_tier(pref + .5). (The halves make the range of\n; size 11, which is needed to properly match the actual integer-sized range.)\n;\n; Substituting gives pref - 10.5 + 11 = log_3(budget / (2000*100/18) / 18^(pref+.5)) + pref+.5,\n; 0 = log_3(budget / K) - (pref + .5) * log_3(18),\n; pref + .5 = log_3(budget / K) / log_3(18),\n; pref = log_18(budget / K) - .5,\n; pref = log_18(budget / (2000*100/18) / 18^.5),\n; pref = log_18(budget / (2000*100/18^.5))\n;\n; The result ends up being intuitive - since the range of stones spans 11 tiers, and\n; our uptiers is also +11 tiers, we want to match the preferred tier to the point where\n; we can just barely afford to buy the stone.\nmuseum.setPreferredTier(max(1, min(50, d2i((gdg({budget}) / (2000.0 * 100.0 / (18.0 ^ 0.5))) // 18.0))))\n\n; We don't care about waiting for the frame break, so manipulate the value\n; directly instead of using \"turbo stop\".\n; This also gives some (useful) extra turbo frames to our caller, Main.\nturbo.register -= 1\n\nbuy:\n; If we're only upgrading 5 or fewer levels, we buy one-at-a-time to avoid\n; overbuying.

And combine is one of the most\n; time-expensive operations in the loop, so we don't want to run it pointlessly.\nexecute(\"{script(Combine)}\")\nexecute(\"{script(Combine)}\")\nexecute(\"{script(Combine)}\")\n\n; Start the buyer. By running this after the combiners, we'll always\n; end each cycle with a full inventory, which is important for the check below.\nexecute(\"{script(Buy)}\")\n\n; Extend the max duration. There is a possible race condition where we might\n; already be exiting turbo due to being at too many cycles; this is dealt with\n; (and discussed more) in Calculate. We can never be in the race condition\n; internally, because it does not take nearly 200 cycles to get from the\n; \"turbo stop\" to this line.\n;\n; Normally we would calculate this based on cycles and cycles.max, but here\n; we're just setting it to the maximum that turbo supports. We rely on our own\n; fps-based throttling, instead. If we *do* manage to go the whole 50000 cycles\n; in less than 200ms, there's an interesting timing effect where we will execute\n; TE2.2:stop *exactly* as the next turbo cycle is beginning, leading to a wasted\n; turbo cycle and drastically slower execution.\nturbo.cycles.max = 50000\n\n; Calculate a time to end the loop at. This is 1/5 of a second in the future,\n; so it should reliably be 5 FPS.\nend_time = now() + 10000000.0 / 5.0\n\n; The core condition to wait for. This condition needs to be as minimal as\n; possible, because it is draining CPU time away from the important combine/buy\n; tasks every cycle. (So is the turbo exec machinery, but we can't help that.)\nwaituntil(tier(\"inventory\", 0) >= target_tier || now() > end_time)\n\n; If we are done, stop the buyers ASAP, to avoid wasting money. The condition\n; here relies on the condition above for correctness, but is simpler.\n; (Technically there's an edge case if it finishes right at the end, but the\n; number of cycles required means that won't happen.)\nstop(if(now() > end_time, \"\", \"{script(Buy)}\"))\n\n; We restart turbo by changing the variable directly, so that there isn't a\n; \"turbo start\" script taking up cycles. In comparison, we stop turbo with\n; executesync(), because we want to block until the end of the frame, and\n; the end of the frame will naturally clean up the script.\nexecutesync(\"TE2.2:stop\")\nturbo.register += 1\n\n; Do another loop if we're not done yet.\n; Abort if the 3rd-to-last power stone is not the tier we expect it to be.\n; Because Buy runs after the combines, and won't have been stopped\n; in the case where we're not done yet, we can expect the \"fill inventory\" buy\n; to have left the final position with our target tier. Checking this way\n; catches both museum rollover and out-of-resources.\n;\n; The reason for checking the 3rd-to-last slot, and not the last slot, has to\n; do with the way combine processing is run: It starts checking for combinable\n; stuff from the first slot down. So it's possible for two base-tier stones to\n; be left in the last two slots, but there can't be *3* in the last 3, because\n; they would be combine-eligible. *Unless* they were just bought. (This isn't\n; quite true, because the combines might be occupied with higher-tier stones,\n; but if we've exausted resources or had rollover, it will rapidly become true.)\n;\n; This also interacts in predictable ways with another couple of common issues:\n; lacking the \"quick combine\" skill and not having all the inventory slots.\n; If all the slots aren't purchased, this condition will always fail immediately.\n; The symptom will be that the combiners seems to \"never do anything.\"\n; Conversely, without quick combine no progress will ever be made. As soon\n; as a power stone is hit that needs fast leveling, it will get \"stuck\" there.\n; This is a sure sign of lacking quick-combine.\n;\n; If we are doing a \"careful\" combine without fill-inventory, it shouldn't take\n; more than 1000 cycles, so this condition won't be a problem.\ngotoif(restart_loop,\\\n  tier(\"inventory\", 0) < target_tier && tier(\"inventory\", 27) == museum_tier)\n\ndone:\n; This is the signal for Main that it should continue.\nmuseum_tier = -2\n\n; Now that we're done, move the finished stone back to \"equipped\".

This is\n;   important because certain things key off of it. target_tier = -2 is the\n;   signal for this.\n;\n; We don't bother doing anything special when the museum isn't open, since\n; we'll handle that at the bottom of the script.\nmuseum_status = if(\\\n  gdg({budget}) < 0.0, \\\n  \"</size>error=<color=#fb3>No available workers!</color>\", \\\n  if(\\\n    turbo.cycles == 0, \\\n    \"</size>error=<color=#fb3>Turbo exec is not working</color>\", \\\n    \"</size>museum=<color=#2f4>\" . \\\n    {rounded_budget} . \\\n    \"</color> <color=#fff>budget</color><br>\" . \\\n    \"<color=#0df><color=#2f4>{up}</color>/<color=#2f4>{down}</color>\" . \\\n    \"changes, <color=#2f4>{start}</color> \" . \\\n    if(\\\n      museum_tier != -2, \\\n      \"begins</color>\", \\\n      \"stops</color><br><color=#fff>Waiting \" . \\\n      {time_floor(60.)} . \":\" . sub(d2s({time_floor(1.)} % 60. + 100.), 1, 2) . \\\n      \"</color>\"\\\n    )\\\n  )\\\n)\n; The s2i()/sub() expression is a jump-table, where the string values are\n; line numbers.\n; The values that target_tier can have when we get here are 0\n; (if it hasn't been set to anything since it was cleared at the top of\n; status_loop), -2 (set when key.{start} is pressed), and -3 (set when\n; budget is adjusted via key.{up}/key.{down}).\n;\n; -2 finishes the loop. -3 should reset target_tier and update status by\n; jumping two lines back. 0 *could* repeat the same line, except sometimes\n; we have to update status, so we jump one back, to set status.\n; We can't merge the -3 and 0 cases, because setting target_tier over-frequently\n; makes keystrokes flaky.\n;\n; We use a modified jump table when museum_tier is -2, which indicates that\n; we are synced to the refresh timer. In that case, we abort when the timer is\n; 59:59 (meaning the refresh just hapenned), and when start is pressed (-2 for\n; target_tier) we jump back to executing Buy, which will reset museum_tier\n; (and also do other things, which we don't care about) in that case.\ngoto(if(\\\n  isopen(\"museum\"), \\\n  if(\\\n    museum_tier == -2 && {timer} >= 59.0 * 60.0 + 59.0, \\\n    start_museum, \\\n    s2i(sub(if(museum_tier == -2, \"41 5\", \"47 5\"), target_tier + 3, 1), 99)\\\n  ),\\\n  end\\\n))\n\nstart_museum:\n; Now that we're in the active part of the script, start turbo.

## Changelog

### v4.7

Increased the max cycles of the combiner to 50000, so that it is solely FPS limited,
and won't run into a glitch that caused the script list to flicker and made it run slow.

Also exported in the smaller compressed format.

### v4.6

Added an upper limit to the budget of 1e280, so it can't get stuck at
"NaNeInfinity".

### v4.5

Throttling is now time-based instead of turbo-cycles-based. All players should
experience the same amount of jank, instead of it being much worse for people
with slow/old computers.
Also, the throttle was adjusted to 5 FPS, which should be enough to not appear
super-janky.

### v4.4

Fix an issue that occured without the Offshore Market: The script would
immediately start a new upgrade cycle after the previous one was finished.

I'm unsure if this had always been hapenning, or if it was caused by a change
in the game.

### v4.3

Change "equipped" to "loadout" in the source. (No functionality change.)
This is not strictly needed, because the old value still works, but it's good
to stay current.

### v4.2

Properly cap tiers at 50, to not waste time/resources when running at very
high budgets.

### v4.1

* Bugfix that would cause eaten stones if the available tiers were too high for
  the budget, but there wasn't anything lower available.
* Another bugfix that more comprehensively protects against *all* potential
  sources of eaten stones. Hopefully, they should be totally a thing of the past.
* Add auto-determination of preferred tier.

### v4.0

Very large rewrite of several core pieces, due to the game's museum overhaul.
* Test stones are no longer used, instead the offers are directly inspected to
  determine the best tiers to buy. In some cases this leads to better outcomes.
* Different functions are used, because the old ones for buying were deprecated.
* Layouts with gaps are now handled fine.
* The timer is now synced directly to the museum's timer, and so it work
  properly with power plant boosts.

### v3.1

Fixed several bugs dealing with universal stones and low-level offers in the
offshore market, particularly T1 universals. (Hopefully. I can't test some of
these directly, because my museum is too upgraded.)

### v3.0

Initial release. (Named v3 because the previous version of this name was v2,
but the code was completely different.)
