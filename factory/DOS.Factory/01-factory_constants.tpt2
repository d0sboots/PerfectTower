; Everything in the list below is a valid target for automation, and can be
; assigned to the "target_type" variable in "lanuch factory craft".
; For example, "make(oven, 10, "machine.oven")" indicates that "oven" is a valid
; item, usable from tiers 1-10, with the internal game name of "machine.oven"
; (which you don't need to worry about.)
; Thus you can enter "oven" in the box in the in-game editor (without the quotes).

; If you add or change this list, mind this constraint:
; * All the crafted items have to come before the rest of the items.
; * All the item-groups must be in a single block.
; * Prefer keeping things in alphabetical order within categories, because
;   they are ordered the same way when presented in-game.

; *** To reiterate, just use the name part (i.e. "white_producer"), not the whole thing! ***

{special(ore, 10, "ore")}

; ----- SCANNABLE ITEM GROUPS -----
; These are not real items, but rather groups of items that will be made together
; if you select one of these names. They are meant for use with the Crafter, to
; crank out sets of items to scan quickly. You will want to set the quantity to 1000.

; Notes on using item groups:
; * SCAN YOUR ORES FIRST! The factory can and will consume your ore to make stuff,
;     and it takes a long time to get 1000 T10 ore.
; * The quantity works a little differently than normal items. Instead of making
;     1000 items each time, running it again will top off everything to be
;     *at* the quantity of 1000 items.
; * If you craft a higher tier after a lower tier, it will consume the results
;     of the first craft to make the higher tier. Scan all the items first, before
;     moving on to the next tier!
; * None of these groups include Gem Producers or Exotic Producers. They are too
;     expensive in comparison to other things, craft them on your own when you
;     judge the time is right.

; Makes *everything* (expect special producers and lumps) of the given tier.
; This is the combination of "chips_and_prods", "machines", and "parts".
; Requires x10 and high processing speed to have a hope of completing in a
; reasonable amount of time for T5 and T10.
; You need Quantum Warehouse to have enough space for this at higher tiers!
{group(all, 10)}

; All the tiers of chips. Warning: Expensive. Input this as tier 1.

; Includes rubber plates at tier 1 and hammers at tier *2*.
; Rubber trees are at tier 9 because of their ore.
